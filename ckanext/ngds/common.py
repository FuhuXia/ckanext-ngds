# Truth is, we can't get everything we need out of ckan.plugins.toolkit because
# not everything we need to extend is exposed through that interface.  This
# file exists as a central place to organize these kinds of dependencies, so
# that we can easily update our code in the future as changes are made in the
# trunk branch of CKAN

<h2>How to Submit Data to the NGDS</h2>

<section class="help-content">
<p>Information resources become part of NGDS when they are web-accessible and described by a metadata record in the NGDS metadata catalog. Metadata records in the NGDS catalog contain instructions used to access the data they describe.</p>

<p>Though hard copy documents, physical specimens, and unstructured data can be listed and described in the NGDS metadata catalog, these data resources are neither web-accessible nor interoperable. For more about metadata, interoperability, and the difference between structured and unstructured data, please see the Data Models, Exchange Methods, and Metadata page.</p>

<p>Data resources can become part of the NGDS by submittal to an existing node or can be self-submitted and self-hosted through the installation and configuration of an NGDS Node-in-a-box built as an NGDS extension on the CKAN platform. <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> stands for Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network. CKAN is modular free-and-open-source repository and data portal software. CKAN has created an NGDS extension in the form of a web-accessible interface by which users can submit and manage metadata records and upload files and datasets.</p>

<h2>NGDS Nodes and Repositories</h2>

<p>An NGDS node is a public, web-accessible interface that makes geothermal-relevant data assets accessible by providing at least one of the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Providing information resources with metadata published through an NGDS catalog node (repository).</li>
	<li>Hosting a web-accessible folder that:
	<ul>
		<li>Contains NGDS-conformant metadata files.</li>
		<li>Is registered for harvesting by an NGDS aggregator (simple metadata publisher).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Hosting one or more NGDS-conformant web services (WMS, WFS, WCS, etc.) registered in an NGDS catalog (data server).</li>
	<li>Hosting a CSW 2.0.2 catalog service that offers metadata conforming to the USGIN ISO profile (metadata publisher).</li>
</ul>

<h3>NGDS Node in a Box</h3>

<p>The NGDS Node-in-a-Box (NIAB) is a software package designed to enable quick deployment of an NGDS node. The software installation includes a CKAN instance along with NGDS-specific extensions for conformance with NGDS metadata requirements, support for NGDS information exchanges, and publication of data through OGC services using a linked GeoServer instance. The NGDS NIAB CKAN extension provides users with a web-accessible user interface designed to help NGDS contributors submit and manage metadata records.</p>

<h4>Installing the NIAB</h4>

<p>Instructions on installing and configuring a NIAB instance are in development and will be available here soon. Contributors interested in installing their own NIAB instance can join the conversation at the <a href="https://github.com/ngds/ckanext-ngds" target="_blank">NGDS CKAN GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4>Finding an Existing NIAB</h4>

<p>In addition to installing and configuring a specific Node-in-a-box instance, a registered user may contribute data using a public account on an existing Node-in-a-box if permission is granted from the Node-in-a-box owner. The data contributor is responsible for contacting the owner of the NIAB for permission. A listing of available NIABs, owners, and contact information is in development.</p>

<h3>Overview: Becoming an NGDS Node</h3>

<p>The simplest way to become an NGDS node is to place file-based information resources in a web-accessible location and then submit metadata describing these resources to the NGDS metadata catalog. Various workflows are available to create and submit metadata:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Log in to an existing registered instance of the NGDS Node-in-a-Box (NIAB) and add metadata records through the provided interface.</li>
	<li>Set up and register an NGDS NIAB instance. This requires:
	<ol>
		<li>Installing and configuring the NGDS NIAB software.</li>
		<li>Registering the NGDS NIAB instance with the NGDS portal.</li>
		<li>Creating a metadata record using the interface provided by your NGDS NIAB instance.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Deploy some other metadata management tool that provides a CSW interface to NGDS-conformant ISO metadata for registered resources, and registering the catalog service with the NGDS central portal for harvesting.</li>
	<li>Create NGDS-conformant ISO metadata records using any other tool and place them in a web-accessible folder that is registered with the NGDS portal for harvesting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Submit Your Metadata Records via a pre-installed NGDS Node-in-a-Box (NIAB)</h2>

<p>Data providers can publish their data to NGDS via any NGDS Node-in-a-Box instance for which they have an account with data publication permission.</p>

<p>Connect to the NGDS NIAB using a web browser; click <a href="http://node.usgin.org/ngds/contribute" target="_blank">Contribute</a> and populate the appropriate forms to submit a metadata record to the catalog. During this process, either upload or specify the web location of an existing web-accessible data resource. Note that uploading data to an instance of the NIAB sacrifices some degree of control over uploaded data and data providers should make appropriate arrangements with the managers of the node that they are publishing data too before uploading.</p>

<p>Create Account and Select Upload Type. To contribute, <strong>sign up</strong> for an account and click <strong>Contribute</strong>; if they are not logged in, users will be prompted to do so upon clicking <strong>Contribute</strong>.</p>

<p>Clicking <strong>Contribute</strong> leads to the <strong>Contribute</strong> page; here, users are presented with two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Individual Upload</strong>: Users create a <em>collection</em> and then add one or more metadata records to this collection; each metadata record describes a data resource. During the metadata record creation process, the user can bind the metadata record to the data resource it describes in one of two ways:

	<ul>
		<li>By providing a hyperlink to the data resource described by a given metadata record</li>
		<li>By uploading the data resource described by a given metadata record</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Bulk Upload</strong>: Users upload large numbers of datasets simultaneously in a single zip file; metadata records are generated automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>To proceed, click either <strong>Individual Upload</strong> or <strong>Bulk Upload</strong>; these options are described below.</p>

<h2>Individual Uploads</h2>

<p>Performing an individual upload is a three-step process:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Create a Collection</strong>: Create a collection that will contain one or more metadata record(s)</li>
	<li><strong>Add Data</strong>: Add one or more metadata record(s) to the collection; each metadata record describes a data resource, which will be either specified or uploaded in this step</li>
	<li><strong>Collection Metadata</strong>: Provide metadata that applies to all metadata records in the collection</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps are described further in the following sections</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Collection</h3>

<p>Clicking <strong>Individual Upload</strong> on the <strong>Contribute</strong> page leads to the <strong>Create a Collection</strong> form; as the name implies, populating this form will create a collection for metadata records, which is the first step of the <strong>Individual Upload</strong> process. The fields on this form are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Title</strong>: Collection title</li>
	<li><strong>URL</strong>: The URL at which this collection will be found. This URL is automatically generated when the <strong>Title</strong> field is populated, but it can be modified manually</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong>: A description of the collection and the metadata records stored in it</li>
	<li><strong>Tags</strong>: Keywords that can be used to search for this collection and any metadata records stored in it</li>
	<li><strong>License</strong>: The license under which any dataset(s) described by any metadata record(s) within this collection are published; among other things, the license determines the manner in which the dataset described by the metadata in this collection can be reused. Information on supported licenses can be found at the following locations:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html" target="_blank">GNU Free Documentation License</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/" target="_blank">Open Data Commons</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/" target="_blank">UK Open Government License</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>When finished, click <strong>Next: Add Data</strong>.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Data</h3>

<p>Clicking <strong>Next: Add Data</strong> on the <strong>Create Collection</strong> form leads to the <strong>Add Data</strong> form. Populating this form creates a metadata record describing a specified data resource; this metadata record is added to the collection created in Step 1. Fields found on this form regardless of the type of resource described by this metadata record are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Resource</strong>: The URL by which the data resource described by this metadata record can be accessed; if a data resource is instead uploaded to the NGDS Node-in-a-Box Repository, this field will be automatically populated</li>
	<li><strong>Name</strong>: The name of the data resource described by this metadata record as it will appear in the metadata catalog</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong>: A brief description of the data resource described by this metadata record</li>
	<li><strong>Structured Resource</strong>: Data that has been mapped to an interchange format such as an <a href="http://schemas.usgin.org/" target="_blank">NGDS data exchange content model</a>; if the data in the dataset described by this metadata record has been mapped to an NGDS data exchange content model, specify the content model to which the data has been mapped. Fields specific to this resource type are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Content Model</strong>: The NGDS content model to which the data resource described by this metadata record conforms</li>
		<li><strong>Content Model Version</strong>: The NGDS content model version to which the data resource described by this metadata record conforms</li>
		<li><strong>Distributor</strong>: The individual, agency, company, or organization responsible for distributing the data resource described by this metadata record</li>
		<li><strong>File Format</strong>: The file format of the data resource described by this metadata record</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Unstructured Resource</strong>: Data such as plain text, a scanned image, or a sound file that cannot be processed or analyzed by machines without user input. Fields specific to this resource type are as follows:</li>
	<li><strong>Distributor</strong>: The individual, agency, company, or organization responsible for distributing the dataset described by this metadata record</li>
	<li><strong>Format</strong>: The file format of the data resource described by this metadata record</li>
	<li><strong>Ordering Procedure</strong>: The manner in which the data resource described by this metadata record can be procured</li>
	<li><strong>Distributor</strong>: The individual, agency, company, or organization responsible for distributing the data resource described by this metadata record</li>
	<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: The specific web service protocol used by the web service specified as the data resource described by this metadata record.</li>
	<li><strong>Layer</strong>: The label for a given data service when it is viewed as a layer in a GIS application</li>
	<li><strong>Offline Resource</strong>: A data resource that is only available in print format. Fields specific to this resource type are as follows:</li>
	<li><strong>Data Service</strong>: Data that is available as a <em>web service</em>; specify the type of web service. Fields specific to this resource type are as follows:</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on data resource types is available on the <a href="data">Data Models, Exchange Methods, and Metadata page</a>.</p>

<p>When the appropriate fields have been populated:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Click <strong>Save &amp; add another</strong> to add another metadata record to the collection; this will repeat the steps described in Step 2</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next: Additional Info</strong> to finalize process by adding collection metadata</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Collection Metadata</h3>

<p>Clicking <strong>Next: Additional Info</strong> leads to the <strong>Collection Metadata</strong> form. Here, provide metadata that applies to the collection created in Step 1 and the metadata records within it created in Step 2.</p>

<p>The <strong>Collection Metadata</strong> form includes the following fields:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Determines whether or not this collection and the metadata record(s) within it are visible to the public</li>
	<li><strong>Authors</strong>: The authors of the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Maintainer</strong>: The individual, agency, company, or organization responsible for the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Spatial Location</strong>: A rough approximation of the features in the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Category</strong>: A description of the type of data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>URI</strong>: A <em>uniform resource identifier</em> for the collection; see the <a href="http://usgin.org/content/usgin-uri-tutorial" target="_blank">USGIN URI Tutorial</a> for more information</li>
	<li><strong>Quality</strong>: A rough assessment of the quality of the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Lineage</strong>: The provenance of data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Status</strong>: The workflow status of data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Publication Date</strong>: The date on which data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection were published</li>
	<li><strong>Language</strong>: The language in which the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection are written</li>
	<li><strong>Dataset Extent</strong>: The physical extent of features in the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection; click the <strong>Draw a rectangle button</strong> (<img alt="images/help/screen-map_controls-search_by_area.PNG" border="0" height="22" src="images/help/screen-map_controls-search_by_area.PNG"></img>)" width="22" />) to draw a box indicating the dataset extent</li>
</ul>

<p>When done, click <strong>Finish</strong>. Doing so will finalize this collection and all metadata records within it; these records will be added to the catalog.</p>

<h2>Bulk Uploads</h2>

<p>Clicking <strong>Bulk Upload</strong> leads to the <strong>Bulk Upload</strong> form. Here, users have the opportunity to upload a .ZIP file containing numerous data resources; the Bulk Upload feature will automatically generate metadata records for each data resource in the ZIP file.</p>

<p>To proceed, click the <strong>Choose File</strong> button on the second row; in the window that appears, locate the desired .ZIP file and click <strong>Open</strong>. In the <strong>Bulk Upload</strong> form, click <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>

<p>Following the successful submission of metadata to a registered instance of the NGDS NIAB, the metadata records will be harvested by the NGDS central portal aggregator (and possibly by other interested catalog operators) and will appear in NGDS catalog searches. Metadata records in this catalog can be used to locate and access the data resources they describe.</p>

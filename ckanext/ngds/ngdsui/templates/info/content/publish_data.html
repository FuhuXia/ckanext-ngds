<h2>How to Submit Data to the NGDS</h2>

<section class="help-content">
<p>Information resources become part of NGDS when they are web-accessible and described by a metadata record in the NGDS metadata catalog. Metadata records in the NGDS catalog contain instructions used to access the data they describe.</p>

<p>Though hard copy documents, physical specimens, and unstructured data can be listed and described in the NGDS metadata catalog, these data resources are neither web-accessible nor interoperable. For more about metadata, interoperability, and the difference between structured and unstructured data, please see the Data Models, Exchange Methods, and Metadata page.</p>

<p>Data resources can become part of the NGDS by submittal to an existing node or can be self-submitted and self-hosted through the installation and configuration of an NGDS Node-in-a-box built as an NGDS extension on the CKAN platform. <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> stands for Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network. CKAN is modular free-and-open-source repository and data portal software. CKAN has created an NGDS extension in the form of a web-accessible interface by which users can submit and manage metadata records and upload files and datasets.</p>

<h2>NGDS Nodes and Repositories</h2>

<p>An NGDS node is a public, web-accessible interface that makes geothermal-relevant data assets accessible by providing at least one of the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Providing information resources with metadata published through an NGDS catalog node (repository).</li>
	<li>Hosting a web-accessible folder that:
	<ul>
		<li>Contains NGDS-conformant metadata files.</li>
		<li>Is registered for harvesting by an NGDS aggregator (simple metadata publisher).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Hosting one or more NGDS-conformant web services (WMS, WFS, WCS, etc.) registered in an NGDS catalog (data server).</li>
	<li>Hosting a CSW 2.0.2 catalog service that offers metadata conforming to the USGIN ISO profile (metadata publisher).</li>
</ul>

<h3>NGDS Node in a Box</h3>

<p>The NGDS Node-in-a-Box (NIAB) is a software package designed to enable quick deployment of an NGDS node. The software installation includes a CKAN instance along with NGDS-specific extensions for conformance with NGDS metadata requirements, support for NGDS information exchanges, and publication of data through OGC services using a linked GeoServer instance. The NGDS NIAB CKAN extension provides users with a web-accessible user interface designed to help NGDS contributors submit and manage metadata records.</p>

<h4>Installing the NIAB</h4>

<p>Instructions on installing and configuring a NIAB instance are available with the following document:</p>

<p><a href="http://ngds.github.io/install-and-run/NGDS_Installation_Documentation.htm">http://ngds.github.io/install-and-run/NGDS_Installation_Documentation.htm</a></p>

<p>This document and other helpful information, including community conversation, are available at <a href="https://github.com/ngds/ckanext-ngds" target="_blank">NGDS CKAN GitHub</a>.</p>


<h4>Finding an Existing NIAB</h4>

<p>In addition to installing and configuring a specific Node-in-a-box instance, a registered user may contribute data using a public account on an existing Node-in-a-box if permission is granted from the Node-in-a-box owner. The data contributor is responsible for contacting the owner of the NIAB for permission. A listing of available NIABs, owners, and contact information is in development.</p>

<h3>Overview: Becoming an NGDS Node</h3>

<p>To become an NGDS node, one must place file-based information resources in a web-accessible location and then submit metadata describing these resources to the NGDS metadata catalog. Various workflows are available to create and submit metadata:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Log in to an existing registered instance of the NGDS Node-in-a-Box (NIAB) and add metadata records through the provided interface.</li>
	<li>Set up and register an NGDS NIAB instance. This requires:
	<ol>
		<li>Installing and configuring the NGDS NIAB software (see Installing the NIAB section above).</li>
		<li>Registering an NGDS NIAB instance with the NGDS portal (main aggregator) via email: <a href="mailto:metadata@usgin.org">metadata@usgin.org</a>.</li>
		<li>Creating metadata records using the interface provided by your NGDS NIAB instance.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Deploy some other metadata management tool that provides a CSW interface to NGDS-conformant ISO metadata for registered resources, and registering the catalog service with the NGDS central portal for harvesting. This will require contacting system adminstrators via email at <a href="mailto:metadata@usgin.org">metadata@usgin.org</a> to harvest your CSW into the main aggregator at <a href="http://www.geothermaldata.org">http://www.geothermaldata.org</a>.</li>
	<li>Create NGDS-conformant ISO metadata records using any other tool and place them in a web-accessible folder that is registered with the NGDS portal for harvesting. Contact system adminstrators via email at <a href="mailto:metadata@usgin.org">metadata@usgin.org</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to Submit Your Metadata Records via a pre-installed NGDS Node-in-a-Box (NIAB)</h2>

<p>Data providers can publish their data to NGDS via any NGDS Node-in-a-Box instance for which they have an account with data publication permission.</p>

<p>Connect to an NGDS NIAB using a web browser and click<strong> Contribute</strong> and populate the appropriate forms to submit a metadata record to the catalog. During this process, either upload a resource or specify the web location of an existing web-accessible data resource. Those providing data to a NIAB that is managed by another entity should make appropriate arrangements with the managers of the node regarding future edits to that data; those who manage their own NIAB have complete control over the data submitted then harvested to the main aggregator for larger use in the system. The nodes (NIAB installations or other node types) will be harvested at intervals, so any edits made at a node will be reflected in the system with the next scheduled harvest.</p>

<p>The following help guide can be navigated at <a href="http://node.usgin.org/ngds/contribute">http://node.usgin.org/ngds/contribute</a> as an example; this site exists only for demonstration purposes.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Collection</h3>

<p>The <strong>Contribute</strong> page leads to the <strong>Create a Collection</strong> form; as the name implies, populating this form will create a collection for a single or multiple metadata records. This is the first step in the file or resource upload process, which will create metadata in the system for that resource. The fields on this form are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Title</strong>: Collection title</li>
	<li><strong>URL</strong>: The URL at which this collection will be found. This URL is automatically generated when the <strong>Title</strong> field is populated, but it can be modified manually</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong>: A description of the collection and the metadata records stored in it</li>
	<li><strong>Tags</strong>: Keywords that can be used to search for this collection and any metadata records stored in it</li>
	<li><strong>License</strong>: The license under which any dataset(s) described by any metadata record(s) within this collection are published; among other things, the license determines the manner in which the dataset described by the metadata in this collection can be reused. Information on supported licenses can be found at the following locations:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html" target="_blank">GNU Free Documentation License</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://opendatacommons.org/" target="_blank">Open Data Commons</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/" target="_blank">UK Open Government License</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>When finished, click <strong>Next: Add Data</strong>.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Data</h3>

<p>Clicking <strong>Next: Add Data</strong> on the <strong>Create Collection</strong> form leads to the <strong>Add Data</strong> form. Populating this form creates a metadata record describing a specified data resource; this metadata record is added to the collection created in Step 1.</p>

<p>Four types of data may be upload. See <a href="http://www.geothermaldata.org/ngds/data">Data Models, Exchange Methods, and Metadata page</a> for helpful text on determining categories (tiers) of data which may be uploaded.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Structured Resource</strong>: Tier 3 structured and standardized data (CSV files). Files submitted here must be &ldquo;schema-valid&rdquo;, which refers to the file as is conforming to the standards of a given information exhange schema. The blank Excel files for a given information exchange are found at <a href="http://schemas.usgin.org/models/">http://schemas.usgin.org/models/</a>. When data conforms to these specifications (field headings, data types, etc.) the file can be validated at <a href="http://schemas.usgin.org/validate/cm">http://schemas.usgin.org/validate/cm</a> before up-loading to the node as a tier 3, structured dataset. After file upload, the option exists to publish the data as OGC web services (WFS and WMS), which have the greatest utility in the system. Once a &ldquo;schema-valid&rdquo; file is uploaded, one must choose the appropriate information exchanges used from the <strong>Content Model</strong> drop-down lists.</li>
	<li><strong>Unstructured Resource</strong>: Tier 1 and 2 data (text, images, structured (but not standardized) files like CSV or Excel, PDF files, etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>Offline Resource</strong>: Metadata record would describe resources which do not exist online such as a core repository.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Service</strong>: Register already published web services such as WMS, WFS, CSW, and OPeNDAP by providing the GetCapabilites or other URL in the <strong>Resource</strong> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the appropriate fields have been populated:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Click <strong>Save &amp; add another</strong> to add another metadata record to the collection; this will repeat the steps described in Step 2.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Next: Additional Info</strong> to finalize process by adding collection metadata.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Collection Metadata</h3>

<p>Clicking <strong>Next: Additional Info</strong> leads to the <strong>Collection Metadata</strong> form. Here, provide metadata that applies to the collection created in Step 1 and the metadata records within it created in Step 2.</p>

<p>The <strong>Collection Metadata</strong> form includes the following fields:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Visibility</strong>: Determines whether or not this collection and the metadata record(s) within it are visible to the public</li>
	<li><strong>Authors</strong>: The authors of the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Maintainer</strong>: The individual, agency, company, or organization responsible for the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Spatial Location</strong>: A rough approximation of the features in the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Category</strong>: A description of the type of data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>URI</strong>: A <em>uniform resource identifier</em> for the collection; see the <a href="http://tech.usgin.org/content/usgin-uri-tutorial" target="_blank">USGIN URI Tutorial</a> for more information</li>
	<li><strong>Quality</strong>: A rough assessment of the quality of the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Lineage</strong>: The provenance of data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Status</strong>: The workflow status of data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection</li>
	<li><strong>Publication Date</strong>: The date on which data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection were published</li>
	<li><strong>Language</strong>: The language in which the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection are written</li>
	<li><strong>Dataset Extent</strong>: The physical extent of features in the data resource(s) described by metadata record(s) in the collection; click the <strong>Draw a rectangle button</strong> (<img src="../images/help/screen-map_controls-search_by_area.PNG" border="0" height="22" width="22"></img>) to draw a box indicating the dataset extent</li>
</ul>

<p>When done, click <strong>Finish</strong>. Doing so will finalize this collection and all metadata records within it; these records will be added to the catalog.</p>

<p>For <strong>Structured Resources</strong>, continue with the following one-click step to publish the resource as OGC WFS and WMS services:</p>

<p>Click <strong>Publish as OGC.</strong></p>

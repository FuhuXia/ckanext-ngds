<h2>Getting Started with the NGDS</h2>

<section class="help-content">
<p>The National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) can be used in a variety of ways, but is typically used for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Finding U.S. geothermal documents and datasets</li>
	<li>Contributing new data</li>
	<li>Developing custom applications based on NGDS data</li>
</ul>

<p>Below you&rsquo;ll find more information that will help you get started using the NGDS.</p>

<h3>Finding and Using Data</h3>

<p>The NGDS is commonly used by state and federal agencies, businesses interested in geothermal resource development, and individuals who are interested in knowing more about geothermal resources. Here&rsquo;s how you can use the NGDS to find and use our data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use our Map to <a href="map">locate data records geographically</a>. </li>
	<li>Visit the Library to <a href="dataset?_tags_limit=0">filter data records by keywords and other criteria</a> such as category, author, or data type.</li>
	<li>The Resources section provides a list of <a href="resources">other free and open-source applications</a> that can also be used to interact with the NGDS data.</li>
	<li>The Help section is available to answer questions on the <a href="help.html">specifics of how to use the site</a> Search, Map, or Library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contributing Your Data to NGDS</h3>

<p>If you have information on geothermal resources, please consider making it available through the NGDS. Documents, datasets, or services that you catalog in the NGDS can be made openly accessible to the public, can remain privately accessible, or can be visible only to others within the contributing agency.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the process works:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you catalog your data with the NGDS, the data itself remains hosted on your own computing resources (or you can make arrangements for hosting with other NGDS nodes).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A record of your data will be entered into the NGDS catalog through metadata records; these metadata records can then be accessed via the <a href="map">Map</a> and <a href="dataset?_tags_limit=0">Library</a>. NGDS metadata describes a given data resource, any restrictions on its use, and how to obtain it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learn more about <u>how to submit your data to the NGDS</u> (LINK TO HOW TO SUBMIT DATA PAGE) or read about our <u>data models, exchange methods, and metadata.</u> (LINK TO DATA MODELS PAGE)</p>

<h3>Developing a Custom Application Using NGDS Data</h3>

<p>NGDS is built on <a href="http://usgin.org/">United States Geoscience Information Network</a> (USGIN) standards, which allows Web developers to easily build innovative custom applications that use NGDS data. Some examples of third party applications might include data gap analysis, financial analysis, and other useful data manipulation.</p>

<p>The National Geothermal Data System provides you with nationwide (and even some international) geothermal relevant data, simply determine if youâ€™re interested in searching via our <a href="/ngds/map">Map interface</a> or <a href="/dataset">Library interface</a>. The <a href="/ngds/map">Map interface</a> allows you to pinpoint specific areas of interest or search by keyword while our <a href="/dataset">Library interface</a> allows you to search by keyword, author, or datatype.</p>

<p><a href="http://usgin.org/tutorial_view_page" target="_blank">General tutorials on the distributed data system</a> are available and specific tutorials on this site are under development. However, our <a href="/help">Help</a> page can provide you with information about how to use the NGDS. Additionally, you can view the <a href="/ngds/faq">FAQs</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in developing some applications for the site, view our Developers page. If you are interested in searching for data using a tool that allows you to extract tabular data, we suggest using the <a href="http://data.geothermaldatasystem.org" target="_blank">data portal and map</a>, which is a "third-party" application to the NGDS.</p>

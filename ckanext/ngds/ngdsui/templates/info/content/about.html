<h2>About NGDS</h2>

<p>The National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) is a distributed data system providing access to information resources
    related to geothermal energy from a network of <a href="http://central.usgin.org/ngds/partners">data providers</a>. Data are contributed by academic researchers, private industry, and state and federal agencies. Built on a scalable and open platform through the <a href="http://usgin.org" target="_blank">U.S. Geoscience Information Network</a> (USGIN), NGDS respects data provenance while promoting shared resources. Since NGDS is built using a set of open protocols and standards, relying on the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC) and <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html" target="_blank">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO), members of the community may access the data in a variety of proprietary and open-source <a href="http://central.usgin.org/ngds/resources">applications and software</a>. In addition, developers can add functionality to the system by creating new applications based on the open protocols and standards of the NGDS.</p>

<p>The NGDS, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technology Office, is intended to provide access to all types of geothermal data to enable geothermal analysis and widespread public use in an effort to reduce the risk of geothermal energy development.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<div class="info_content">
    
	<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) <a href="ngds/map">Map</a> or <a href="dataset?_tags_limit=0">Library</a> to locate the data records you are looking for, you can use the resources, models, and tools described here to interact with the data.</p>

<p>Here are the categories of tools and resources available:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#exploration">Geothermal exploration</a></li>
	<li><a href="#financial">Financial</a></li>
	<li><a href="#gis">Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data applications</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Have you developed a custom application to analyze NGDS data?</strong> If you have used NGDS data to develop a third party application that could also benefit others, please <a href="mailto:ngdsweb@geothermaldata.org?subject=Third%20party%20application">share it with us</a> so we can include it here.</p>

<a id="exploration" name="exploration"></a><h2>Geothermal Exploration</h2>

<p>The following tools and resources can be used to facilitate your geothermal exploration.</p>

<ul>
	<li>NREL <a href="http://maps.nrel.gov/gt_prospector" target="_blank">Geothermal Prospector</a>: A Web-accessible mapping tool developed for the geothermal power industry. This tool is designed to provide easy access to geothermal resource datasets and other data relevant to utility-scale geothermal power projects. Geothermal Prospector can load NGDS Web Map Services (WMS) and Web Feature Services (WFS) to facilitate exploration - e.g., Reservoir models.</li>
	<li><a href="http://data.geothermaldatasystem.org/" target="_blank">NGDS Data Explorer</a>: A Web application designed to load and display NGDS WFS from a text or location search. When a WFS has been loaded, a user can then export attributes (standardized data) from this service as an HTML table, CSV file, or Microsoft Excel workbook. Please note that the user can load more than one WFS at a time.</li>
</ul>

<a id="financial" name="financial"></a><h2>Financial</h2>

<p>The following tools, models, and resources can be used to predict and provide information about the costs of geothermal development.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://geofrat.egi.utah.edu/" target="_blank">GeoFRAT</a>: Geothermal Financial Risk Classification and Assessment Tool (GeoFRAT) is an NGDS application that helps users assess the resource potential and financial risks that may be associated with producing electricity from a given geothermal resource. When used in conjunction with other widgets and tools such as <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/getem.html" target="_blank">GETEM</a>, GeoFRAT can help you conduct detailed risk analysis for a geothermal resource development project.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/getem.html" target="_blank">Geothermal Electricity Technology Evaluation Model</a> (GETEM): This tool models the estimated performance and costs of currently available U.S. geothermal power systems. GETEM can analyze and evaluate currently available technologies and estimate the cost of certain technologies five to 20 years in the future. The model is intended to help the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) determine which proposed RD&amp;D programs and projects offer the greatest prospective return on investment (ROI).</li>
</ul>

<a id="gis" name="gis"></a><h2>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Data Applications</h2>

<p>These Web, desktop, and GIS software applications can be used to access, explore, visualize, and analyze NGDS data. Some GIS software is free or open source.</p>

<h3>Free and Open-Source Desktop GIS Software</h3>

<h3>Data Applications</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://i-gis.dk/Home/tabid/40/language/en-GB/Default.aspx" target="_blank">GeoScene 3D</a>: GeoScene3D is an application for 2D and 3D visualizing, interpreting, editing and publishing geological data, including drill or bore holes, terrain, and geologic units. This application is intended for 3D viewing, so there is not an extensive base map selection. Although additional steps are required to view Web map services in this application, it is WMS-aware.</li>
	<li><a href="http://geozilla.de/index.php" target="_blank">Geozilla</a>: A free application that provides 3D terrain views with Web map service overlays.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>: A free application that provides 3D terrain views with Web map service overlays.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Worldwide Telescope</a>: A free application that provides 3D terrain views. This application does not yet support WMS, but it can consume .CSV files to provide visualizations events as data points over time. These data points can be assigned different colors and sizes for further visualization of data, though doing so can require extensive preparation. See more information on <a href="http://www.layerscape.org/Content/Index/453" target="_blank">importing data</a>.</li>

        <h3>General</h3>

        <p>The National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) is a distributed data system providing access to information
            resources related to geothermal energy from a network of data providers. Data are contributed by academic
            researchers, private industry, and state and federal agencies. Built on a scalable and open platform through
            the U.S. Geoscience Information Network (USGIN), NGDS respects data provenance while promoting shared
            resources. Since NGDS is built using a set of open protocols and standards, relying on the Open Geospatial
            Consortium (OGC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), members of the community may
            access the data in a variety of proprietary and open-source applications and software. In addition,
            developers can add functionality to the system by creating new applications based on the open protocols and
            standards of the NGDS.</p>

        <p>The NGDS, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technology Program, is intended to provide
            access to all types of geothermal data to enable geothermal analysis and widespread public use in an effort
            to reduce the risk of geothermal energy development.</p>
